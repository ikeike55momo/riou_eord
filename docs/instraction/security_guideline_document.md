# Security Guideline Document & Implementation Plan

This document outlines the security guidelines and implementation plan for the Keyword Auto-Suggestion Web App. The plan emphasizes security by design and follows core principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, and secure defaults.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Keyword Auto-Suggestion Web App Development
- **Purpose:** To leverage an AI agent for generating SEO/MEO-optimized keywords used in natural-sounding customer reviews.
- **Target Users:** Internal staff from approximately 10 facilities
- **Key Features:**
  - Secure login with NextAuth supporting USER and admin roles
  - Facility data input (25 fields + additional remarks)
  - AI-powered keyword generation through crawling, summarization, and GPT-4
  - Categorized keyword output (Menu & Services, Environment & Facilities, Recommended Usage Scenes)
  - CSV export for integration with the review generation system
  - Overwriting of previous keyword data
- **Hosting & Database:**
  - Hosting on Netlify with serverless functions
  - Database using Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## 2. Security Requirements & Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Secure Login and Session Management**:
  - Implement robust authentication using NextAuth (with OAuth or email links).
  - Enforce strong password policies and review user roles (USER and admin) regularly.
  - Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Define and enforce roles, ensuring authorization checks on all endpoints.
  - Validate tokens and permissions server-side to prevent privilege escalation.

### Data Protection

- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest in Supabase and in transit using HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
  - Utilize strong encryption algorithms like AES-256.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
  - Validate all user and API inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Sanitize outputs to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) risks.

- **Regular Backups:**
  - Schedule backups for the Supabase database and secure the backup storage.

### API Key & Secret Management

- **Netlify Environment Variables:**
  - Securely store API keys and sensitive configuration using Netlify environment variables.
  - Avoid hardcoding secrets in the source code.

- **Rate Limiting & Monitoring:**
  - Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
  - Enable detailed logging to track login attempts and API access.

### Netlify & NextAuth Configuration

- **UntrustedHost Error Resolution:**
  - Configure `trustHost: true` in NextAuth or properly set `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL` environment variables to handle Netlify deployments.

- **Secure Defaults:**
  - Regularly review and update Netlify security best practices and domain settings.

### AI Agent and Crawling Security

- **AI Agent (LangChain/Auto-GPT):**
  - Keep up-to-date with security advisories and regularly review code for vulnerabilities.
  - Maintain limited permissions and isolation for the AI agent processes.

- **Crawling (Firecrawl):**
  - Monitor for changes in website structure to avoid crawling errors.
  - Validate and sanitize any data obtained from crawling external sources.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Security-First Design

- **Embed Security in the Development Lifecycle:**
  - Adopt secure coding best practices following the principle of "Security by Design" from the onset.
  - Plan for regular security audits and code reviews.

### Step 2: Authentication & Authorization Setup

- **NextAuth Configuration:**
  - Enforce secure session management, including generation of unpredictable session tokens, setting HttpOnly cookies, and ensuring session timeouts.
  - Address the "UntrustedHost" error with proper settings (trustHost, NEXTAUTH_URL variables).

- **RBAC Implementation:**
  - Define clear roles (USER and admin) and strictly implement permission checks across all endpoints.

### Step 3: Data & API Protection

- **Database Security:**
  - Encrypt data stored in Supabase (implement at-rest encryption) and use secure database credentials with minimum privileges.

- **Input Handling:**
  - Add server-side validation for all forms (facility information input) and API endpoints to sanitize incoming data.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization checks.
  - Leverage prepared statements or ORM features to protect against SQL injection.

### Step 4: Infrastructure Hardening

- **Netlify Configuration:**
  - Secure serverless functions by verifying proper environment variable configuration and using security headers.

- **TLS & Other Security Measures:**
  - Ensure that all communications use TLS (minimum version 1.2) and that security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) are properly set.

### Step 5: Monitoring, Logging & Maintenance

- **Logging & Alerts:**
  - Implement logging for critical events (login attempts, API usage, errors) and set up alerts for suspicious activities.

- **Regular Security Reviews and Dependency Management:**
  - Use tools for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to regularly scan dependencies and ensure all libraries remain updated.

## 4. Conclusion

This security guideline and implementation plan is designed to ensure the development of a robust, secure, and compliant Keyword Auto-Suggestion Web App. By following these guidelines and integrating security at every phase of the project, we help protect sensitive data, maintain a strong security posture for internal operations, and adapt to evolving threats in the security landscape.

For any further clarifications or security concerns, please flag the issue for review before proceeding with development.
