# Frontend Guideline Document

This document outlines the frontend setup for the project “キーワード自動提案Webアプリ開発” (Keyword Auto-Suggestion Web App Development). It explains our architecture, key design decisions, and the tools we use to build a fast, accessible, and easy-to-use application. The overview is presented in everyday language, so anyone can follow along and understand how things work.

## 1. Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built using a modern stack designed for speed and ease of development:

- **Vite.js:** A fast build tool that helps us get up and running quickly, and speeds up development and production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS:** This utility-first CSS framework makes styling faster and ensures that our design remains consistent.
- **TypeScript:** This provides us with extra safety and clarity when writing JavaScript, reducing bugs and improving maintainability.
- **shadcn/ui:** A collection of UI components that follow modern design principles and are pre-built for efficiency and accessibility.

In addition to these, we integrate with NextAuth (powered by Auth.js) for authentication, ensuring secure access for both regular users and admins. Our setup supports scalability through component reuse and efficient state management. Everything is organized to support performance (via lazy loading and code splitting) and easy future expansion.

## 2. Design Principles

Our design approach focuses on these core principles:

- **Usability:** The interface is intuitive, making it easy for internal users to complete tasks like logging in, entering facility data, or generating keywords.
- **Accessibility:** We are committed to building a web application that everyone, including those with disabilities, can use effectively. This means following best practices for keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and contrast ratios.
- **Responsiveness:** The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes – whether it’s on a large monitor or a small tablet – ensuring a smooth experience.

These principles are applied by keeping the user interface simple and clutter-free, encouraging the user to focus on entering facility information, reviewing AI-generated keywords, and navigating easily between sections.

## 3. Styling and Theming

Our styling and theming approach makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and modern feel across the application:

- **CSS Methodology:** We use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework. This reduces the need for writing tons of custom CSS, while still allowing customization through utility classes. This approach is similar in spirit to BEM but in a more modern and simplified form.
- **Pre-Processors:** Tailwind eliminates much of the need for extra pre-processors like SASS, but should there be a need, its configuration is straightforward.
- **Visual Style:** Our visual style is modern with a hint of material design elements. We aim for a clean, minimalistic interface that feels modern and professional.
- **Color Palette:** We use a color palette that includes a primary color (deep blue), a secondary color (vibrant teal), and neutral tones (soft grays and whites) to keep the design fresh.
- **Fonts:** The application uses a modern sans-serif font, such as Inter, which is easy to read and fits with the overall minimalistic style.

Consistency is maintained by defining these styles in a central config file that both Tailwind and the custom component library (shadcn/ui) reference.

## 4. Component Structure

We keep the frontend modular and maintainable by breaking it down into reusable components. Here’s how we organize them:

- **Wrapper Components:** These are higher-level components that define the layout and structure, like page containers and navigation bars.
- **Functional Components:** For specific functions, such as login forms, facility input forms, or keyword display blocks.
- **Reusable UI Elements:** Buttons, form fields, and notification messages that appear in multiple parts of the application come from shadcn/ui.

This component-based architecture encourages reusability and makes it simpler for developers to manage and update the UI as the project evolves.

## 5. State Management

Managing state effectively is key for user experience in our application:

- **State Management Approach:** We use built-in React state management and the Context API where needed; this is sufficient for handling localized state as well as sharing state between components. For more complex interactions, the module structure ensures that changes in state (such as the result of a keyword generation) are reflected immediately across relevant parts of the UI.
- **Consistency and Performance:** Sharing state correctly means that changes (like new keyword data or form validations) instantly and safely update the relevant components, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience.

## 6. Routing and Navigation

Navigation within the app is managed through a clear and straightforward routing structure:

- **Routing Library:** Although this is a Vite.js application, we implement routing similar to what React Router offers. This means routes are clearly defined for login, facility inputs, keyword generation, and CSV output pages.
- **User Flow:** After logging in, users are directed to a dashboard where they can enter facility information, trigger AI keyword generation, review/edit keywords, and download CSVs for the review system.
- **Role-Based Navigation:** Depending on whether a user is an internal user or an admin, navigation components will adjust to show or hide certain features (like additional admin tools).

## 7. Performance Optimization

We’ve built performance into every step of our project:

- **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting:** Only load components when needed, reducing the initial load time and making the app feel responsive.
- **Asset Optimization:** Images, scripts, and styles are optimized with tools that minimize file sizes to speed up downloads and interactions.
- **Efficient Component Rendering:** Our use of Vite.js and React ensures that only parts of the page that need to update do so, keeping the UI fast and reactive.

These strategies ensure that keyword generation and other interactions complete within seconds, keeping the user experience smooth.

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

Quality is a top priority. We follow a multifaceted testing strategy:

- **Unit Testing:** Each component is tested independently to catch issues early. Tools like Jest and React Testing Library come in handy for this.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensuring that different components work together as expected, especially regarding form submissions, API interactions, and authentication flows.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Tools like Cypress allow us to simulate real user interactions (e.g., logging in, inputting facility data, and generating keywords) to ensure the system works holistically.

These testing measures are built into our continuous integration process to catch issues early and ensure reliability at every release stage.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

In this guide, we summarized everything from our modern tech stack (Vite.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui) to our clear and modular component structure. We stressed design principles that focus on usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. Our state management and routing are designed to keep the user experience smooth, and our performance optimizations ensure that every interaction is quick and efficient.

This frontend setup not only meets our project’s current needs (such as secure internal access, facility input, and AI-driven keyword generation) but also lays a solid foundation for future growth and new features. Overall, our approach makes it easy for developers to maintain, update, and expand an application that provides real value to internal teams and differentiates our project from others.
